# Pint 🍺
A programming language brewed 🍺 with love ❤ and the finest emojis 😀

## How to use
To transpile a Pint file to python, run `python debrewer.py <input> [-o <output>] [-t]`. The `-o` flag specifies the output file, and the `-t` flag specifies that the output should be printed to the terminal. 

## Testing
Simple tests compare translated files to model ones from the examples directory.
Usage: `python -m unittest`
